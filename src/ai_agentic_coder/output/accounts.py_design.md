# accounts.py Module Design
================================

## Overview
The accounts.py module is designed to provide a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It allows users to create an account, deposit funds, withdraw funds, buy and sell shares, and view their portfolio and transaction history.

## Classes and Functions
-----------------------

### `class Account`
------------------

#### `__init__(self, initial_balance=0)`
 Initializes a new account with an optional initial balance.

#### `deposit(self, amount)`
 Deposits funds into the account.

*   Raises `ValueError` if the deposit amount is negative.

#### `withdraw(self, amount)`
 Withdraws funds from the account.

*   Raises `ValueError` if the withdrawal amount is negative or exceeds the available balance.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol, quantity)`
 Records the purchase of shares.

*   Raises `ValueError` if the quantity is negative or if the user cannot afford the shares.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol, quantity)`
 Records the sale of shares.

*   Raises `ValueError` if the quantity is negative or if the user does not own the shares.

#### `get_portfolio_value(self)`
 Returns the total value of the user's portfolio.

#### `get_profit_loss(self)`
 Returns the profit or loss from the initial deposit.

#### `get_holdings(self)`
 Returns a dictionary of the user's current holdings.

#### `get_transaction_history(self)`
 Returns a list of the user's transactions.

### `get_share_price(symbol)`
 Returns the current price of a share.

*   Includes a test implementation that returns fixed prices for AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL.

### Example Usage
```python
# Create a new account with an initial balance of $1000
account = Account(1000)

# Deposit $500 into the account
account.deposit(500)

# Buy 10 shares of AAPL
account.buy_shares("AAPL", 10)

# Sell 5 shares of AAPL
account.sell_shares("AAPL", 5)

# Get the portfolio value
portfolio_value = account.get_portfolio_value()

# Get the profit or loss
profit_loss = account.get_profit_loss()

# Get the holdings
holdings = account.get_holdings()

# Get the transaction history
transaction_history = account.get_transaction_history()
```
### Implementation
The implementation will use a dictionary to store the user's holdings, where each key is a symbol and the value is the quantity of shares owned. The `get_portfolio_value` method will iterate over the holdings and calculate the total value using the `get_share_price` function. The `get_profit_loss` method will calculate the profit or loss by subtracting the initial deposit from the current portfolio value.

The `buy_shares` and `sell_shares` methods will update the holdings dictionary and raise exceptions if the user cannot afford the shares or does not own the shares. The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods will update the available balance and raise exceptions if the deposit or withdrawal amount is invalid.

The `get_transaction_history` method will return a list of transactions, where each transaction is a dictionary containing the symbol, quantity, and price of the shares.

Note that this is a simplified design and does not include error handling or security measures that would be required in a real-world implementation.
